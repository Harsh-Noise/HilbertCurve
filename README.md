# HilbertCurve
A space filling curve, a projection of a 1D object into 2D space.

Classes:
  Unit.java - Basic building block of a Hilbert curve. Contains information describing its orientation, location on the x/y plane, as well as a method for iterating itself to expand the curve. Can contain an object.

  HilbertCurve.java - Contains the curve, an array of Units. Also used to iterate the whole curve.
